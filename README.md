# ptv-sdk-ios-release
Hosts binaries for core PTVSDK for iOS as of v0.7.0.

## Installation

PTVSDK is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'PTVSDK'
```

The PTVSDK framework is developed in Swift and is delivered through a compiled binary. The standard CocoaPod package is built with the latest Xcode GM (Golden Master) Swift compiler for Mac OS X. To include a build compiled from an older version of Swift, or beta releases of Xcode, specify the Swift version using the CocoaPod subspec format.

```ruby
pod 'PTVSDK/Swift5.0`
```
